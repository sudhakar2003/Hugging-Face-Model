# Hugging-Face-Model

The text summarization app is a web application that allows users to input text and receive a summarized version of that text. The app uses a pre-trained text summarization model from the Hugging Face `transformers` library to generate the summary.

Here's how the app works:

1. **Input Text**: Users can enter text into a text area provided by the app. This text can be a long article, a news story, or any other type of document that the user wants to summarize.

2. **Summarization**: When the user clicks the "Summarize" button, the app sends the input text to the text summarization model. The model processes the text and generates a summarized version of it.

3. **Display Summary**: The app then displays the summarized text to the user. This summary is usually shorter than the original text but contains the main points and key information from the input text.

4. **Customization**: The app may allow users to customize the length of the summary or other parameters used by the text summarization model to generate the summary.

Overall, the text summarization app provides a convenient way for users to quickly get a condensed version of a longer piece of text, making it easier to grasp the main ideas and key points.
